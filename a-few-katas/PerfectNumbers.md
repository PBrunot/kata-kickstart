Perfect numbers
===============

A **perfect number** is a natural number for which the sum of its proper divisors
(i.e. all its divisors except itself) is exactly equal to the number.

For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 6 is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

On the other hand, if the sum of the proper divisors is:

- greater than the number, it is called an **abundant number**;
- less than the number, it is called a **deficient number**.

Write a function that can classify a number as perfect, abundant or deficient.
